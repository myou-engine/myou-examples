### Preparation

* `npm install -g webpack`
* `npm update` (inside this repo directory)

### Running

You can run examples in two ways

1. From the browser using __Webpack__

    ```
    cd [myou-examples]/[example]
    webpack
    node run_server.js
    ```

    Alternatively, you can configure your browser to allow file access to avoid using the server.

2. Natively using __Electron__

    ```
    cd [myou-examples]/[example]
    node electron_launcher.js
    ```
